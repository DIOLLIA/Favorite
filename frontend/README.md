<Link>
In Next.js, you can use the <Link /> Component to link between pages in your application. <Link> allows
you to do client-side navigation with JavaScript. <a> will reload all the page

Whenever <Link> components appear in the browser's viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches
the code for the linked route in the background. By the time the user clicks the link, the code for the
destination page will already be loaded in the background
